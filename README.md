# CMPE 413 Final Project
This is the final project for CMPE 413 done by Daniel Cleaver and Mick Harrigan

## Description
[Here][1] is the link to the designating file that describes what the project is in full. This repo contains the beginning VHDL code that is used to then later create the specified schematis as well as layouts for this system.


## Usage
Firstly, clone the repo into a suitable location for testing. From here make sure to update the line `CADENCE` in the Makefile.
Point this to the directory of the cds.lib and hdl.var files.

To then compile each module use the name of said module, or make all to make the full system.

## Next Steps
- Create the generalized counter
- Create the generalized decoder
